# TibiaData docker-compose

TibiaData docker-compose configurations for TibiaData container, Kong API gateway and Konga admin GUI.

**Note**:\
Hosting of TibiaData has been switched to Kubernetes, so maintenance of this repository is limited.

## Folders

There are following folders..

### [kong](./kong/)

Used to get [Kong API](https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong) gateway up and runnig.

This is for administration of the Kong API gateway.
